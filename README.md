## Overview

The RPS app that provide users with a fun and interactive way to play the classic game of Rock Paper Scissors. Users will be able to choose their move (rock, paper, or scissors) by clicking on a corresponding button on the screen, and the computer will randomly generate its own move.

The application will then determine the winner based on the rules of the game: rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock.

The game is designed to play five rounds only, providing a quick and simple game-play experience for the user.
